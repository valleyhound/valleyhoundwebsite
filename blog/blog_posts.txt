<img src="/assets/images/blog/newwebsite.jpg">
We've redesigned the website today to look a bit more modern and less like a high school IT assignment.
Took some inspiration from various indie game studio's websites.

Let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/ValleyHoundUK">twitter!</a>

[newblog(07/03/2023,16:27 GMT,Where is Wyoming Winter 1.12?)]
Wyoming winter 1.11 was released over 4 months ago now and another version has yet to be released. 
1.12 is coming, it has just been a longer than anticipated journey due to an unexpected need to restructure the code base and a lot of new features to bug test.

We hope to have 1.12 released before the end of this month, so far it is looking to be a very nice update :)

Cheers,

[newblog(07/03/2023,02:04 GMT,The Start of ValleyHound's Blog!)]
We've created this nifty little Javascript based blogging tool that simply reads from a blog posts text file and using some custom markup splits it into seperate blog posts and their meta data.

Its quite nice to use and very simple, which is usually the best option as they say.
Anyway, this blog will contain updates on what we are doing with our time, what we are working on and how its coming along, plus general news with the website and our work. I hope this will become a useful tool to see into our workflow!

Cheers,
ValleyHound
