            <h2>About</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We are a small British independent game studio & publisher creating quality PC games. 
                <br><br>
                Our current flagship is Wyoming Winter which was released in December 2022 on Steam. It is a multiplayer arcade horror game in which a group of department of defence employees sneak around an office complex in hopes of finding a defence against the entity stalking them through the hallways.
                <br><br>
                We honestly strive to only publish games we ourselves find fun. Origional, fun experiences from the start.
